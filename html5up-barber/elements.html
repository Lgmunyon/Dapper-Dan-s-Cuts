										<h3>Alan</h3>
										<h4>Co-founder/Barber</h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/barber4.jpg" alt="" /></span>After finishing his tour with the Coast Guard, Alan came home to plant (and cut) roots. Born and raised in Atlanta, Alan wanted to give back to his community. Offering to cut hair for the less fortunate in his neighborhood Alan eventually decided to open up shop. As his skills grew, so did his clientele. He's now proud to have the second shop open in Buckhead. He'll still offer cuts to those who can't afford to get one on the weekends.&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br></p>
										<p>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</p>

											<h3>Jauffrey</h3>
											<h4>Blade Master</h4>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/crew1.jpg" alt="" /></span>Jauffrey, who goes by "King", came to us from Los Angeles. We're glad he did. King was born and raised on the West Coast, where his mom was a hairdresser. Once he got to the age that he didn't want a bowl cut anymore, King took to cutting his own hair. Through trial & error, and lots of it, he eventually honed his skills and started working at the same salon as his mom. Being the only man there cutting hair, they dubbed him "King". He now graces us with his presence here in Atlanta and is particularly smooth with a straight blade.</p>
										<p>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</p>

											<h3>Morrigan</h3>
											<h4>Color Magician</h4>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/crew2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Coming to us from New York, learning at the Paul Mitchell Beauty Academy, Morrigan is straight magic with color. Never one to stay the same for too long, Morrigan had a new hair style every month through school. This is when she started experimenting with color. When her dad said she was spending too much at the salon, Morrigan took it upon herself to color her own hair; developing it into a passion and side gig in high school. </p>
										<p>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</p>

											<h3>Arthur</h3>
											<h4>Everything Else</h4>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/crew3.jpg" alt="" /></span>What is there to say about Arthur? If no one else can give you the cut of your dreams, he certainly can. Arthur was Alan's childhood friend, and the one who inspired Oscar to help the community through his skills as a barber. Arthur, never one to be outdone, took it upon himself to learn everything Alan knew and then-some. Now he proudly works alongside his best friend, and never lets Alan forget that he's the best.</p>
